## Note

### Camera
Webcam support is currently only available for PC using Unityâ€™s native API.
To add support for other platforms, you will need to implement it yourself.

### File Picker
Unity does not have a native file picker, so we have discontinued support for this feature.
To add support for a file picker, you will need to implement it yourself.
